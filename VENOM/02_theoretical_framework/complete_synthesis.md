# The Complete Framework: Greek × Cynefin × Guilds × AI

## The Knowledge Architecture That Was

Medieval guilds operationalized what Greeks theorized and Cynefin maps:

| Cynefin Domain | Greek Knowledge | Guild Implementation | Modern Loss |
|----------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Simple | Episteme | Written procedures | Only this remains |
| Complicated | Techne + Episteme | Craft mastery | Reduced to process |
| Complex | Phronesis | Master judgment | Eliminated entirely |
| Chaotic | Metis | Crisis improvisation | Forbidden |
| Disorder | Nous | Intuitive grasp | Not recognized |

## The Systematic Reduction

1. **Greeks**: 17+ cognitive categories for complete understanding
2. **Guilds**: All categories maintained through apprenticeship
3. **Industrial**: Reduction to episteme (procedures) only
4. **Modern**: 4 DIKW categories (all variants of episteme)
5. **AI Age**: Even episteme being extracted and automated

We haven't just lost knowledge—we've lost ways of knowing.

## The Revolutionary Recognition

Guilds prove alternative knowledge systems are possible. Their destruction proves these systems must be actively eliminated by power. Their modern revival attempts (however corrupted) prove we recognize the loss.

The question isn't whether we can maintain cognitive diversity—guilds proved we can. The question is whether we can prevent its political destruction.
