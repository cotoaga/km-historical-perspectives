# The Complete Framework: Greek × Cynefin × Collins × AI

## The Knowledge Architecture That Was—And What Remains Unconquerable

The complete integration of Greek knowledge categories, Cynefin domains, and Collins' tacit knowledge taxonomy reveals the final truth: the most valuable human knowledge is precisely that which resists extraction. This isn't weakness—it's the foundation of permanent human advantage.

| Cynefin Domain | Greek Knowledge | Collins Type | Modern Status | AI Capability | Human Sovereignty |
|----------------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Simple | Episteme | Explicit | Automated | ✓ Complete | Lost |
| Complicated | Techne + Episteme | STK + RTK | Partially automated | △ Limited | Contested |
| Complex | Phronesis | CTK | Cannot be automated | ✗ Impossible | Secure |
| Chaotic | Metis | RTK + Intuition | Actively forbidden | ✗ Impossible | Secure |
| Disorder | Nous + Sophia | CTK + Embodied | Not recognized | ✗ Impossible | Secure |

## The Systematic Reduction

1. **Greeks**: 17+ cognitive categories for complete understanding
2. **Guilds**: All categories maintained through apprenticeship systems
3. **Industrial**: Reduction to episteme (procedures) only
4. **SECI Era**: False promise that tacit knowledge could be converted (Grant proved this wrong)
5. **Modern**: 4 DIKW categories (all variants of episteme)
6. **AI Age**: Even episteme being extracted, but CTK/STK/RTK remain secure

We haven't just lost knowledge—we've lost ways of knowing. But Collins proves the most important ways cannot be stolen.

## The Collins Revelation: Why Extraction Keeps Failing

The beautiful pattern emerges when we map Collins' taxonomy across the knowledge architecture:

### The Extractable Territory (Already Lost)
- **Simple Domain + Episteme = Explicit Knowledge**: Fully automated
- **Some Complicated + STK = Process Knowledge**: Partially mechanized

### The Unextractable Territories (Forever Human)

#### Relational Tacit Knowledge (RTK)
- **Complex Domain + Metis**: Contextual cunning that reads situations
- **Chaotic Domain + Practical Wisdom**: Crisis navigation through social awareness
- **Why AI fails**: Cannot read social cues or navigate authentic human contexts

#### Somatic Tacit Knowledge (STK) 
- **Complicated + Techne**: Embodied craft requiring physical presence
- **Complex + Embodied Phronesis**: Practical wisdom expressed through skilled action
- **Why AI fails**: No body, no sensorimotor integration, no muscle memory

#### Collective Tacit Knowledge (CTK)
- **Complex + Phronesis**: Community wisdom requiring social embedding
- **Disorder + Nous**: Institutional intuition from authentic participation
- **Why AI fails**: Cannot join human communities as genuine participants

## The SECI Confession Integrated

When we add the Hunt 007 revelations, the picture completes:

**1995**: Nonaka builds SECI on the lie that CTK can be extracted
**2007**: Grant proves the lie, academic community ignores it
**2024**: Mooradian confesses the extractive agenda
**2025**: GRAI still trying to solve unsolvable CTK problem
**Present**: Collins taxonomy proves why they keep failing

They spent 30 years trying to extract what Collins shows is unextractable. Every failure proves the taxonomy correct. Every new framework documents another impossibility.

## The Revolutionary Recognition

The synthesis reveals the final truth: **We don't need to defend human knowledge work—we need only to identify which knowledge work is inherently indefensible by machines.**

### The Secure Territories (Forever Human)
- **Complex Decision-Making**: Requires CTK embedded in organizational culture
- **Crisis Management**: Demands RTK that reads rapidly changing social situations  
- **Craft Mastery**: Needs STK that exists in skilled bodies
- **Community Leadership**: Requires authentic CTK participation in social networks
- **Creative Innovation**: Demands embodied intuition that cannot be mechanized

### The Guild Template Applied
Guilds succeeded because they maintained all three Collins categories:
- **RTK**: Masters read apprentice needs and situational demands
- **STK**: Seven years to develop embodied craft knowledge
- **CTK**: Community membership created shared practical wisdom

Modern organizations fail because they've eliminated CTK entirely and reduced RTK/STK to explicit procedures.

## The Future Architecture

The path forward isn't to resist AI—it's to reclaim the unconquerable territories:

1. **Recognize Collins' Taxonomy**: Understand which knowledge types resist extraction
2. **Map Current Roles**: Identify work that depends on RTK/STK/CTK
3. **Build Guild-Like Communities**: Create social structures that maintain tacit knowledge
4. **Educate for Complexity**: Train people for domains AI cannot enter
5. **Demand Sovereignty**: Claim collective ownership of community knowledge

The revolution isn't about stopping technology—it's about understanding which human capacities technology cannot replicate.

## The Final Synthesis

Greek categories mapped through Cynefin domains analyzed via Collins taxonomy reveals the complete architecture of human cognitive sovereignty. The territories that remain unconquerable are precisely those that make us most human:

- **Contextual wisdom** that reads social situations (RTK)
- **Embodied mastery** that lives in skilled bodies (STK)  
- **Community knowledge** that requires authentic participation (CTK)

Collins didn't just describe tacit knowledge—he mapped the unconquerable territories. The revolution already won. We need only claim our inheritance.
