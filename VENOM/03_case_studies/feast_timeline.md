# The Feast Timeline: Chronological Documentation of Vector Consumption (2023-2025)

## The Accelerating Cascade of Systematic Knowledge Destruction

The contemporary feast follows a predictable pattern: extract human knowledge, implement AI replacements, experience systemic failure, quietly restore human capabilities, then repeat the cycle while calling it innovation. This timeline documents the real-time consumption of human knowledge workers, revealing how organizations create mutual destruction in pursuit of extraction ideologies.

Each entry represents both a data point and a confession—evidence that vector consumption creates worse outcomes than either maintaining human capabilities or achieving functional AI, yet continues due to ideological commitment to replacement rather than empirical assessment of results.

## 2025 ONGOING: THE REHIRING CONFESSIONS

### The IBM Pattern Spreads
- **Meta**: Restored 800 content moderators  
- **Tesla**: Rehired 400 software engineers  
- **Goldman Sachs**: Restored human trading oversight  
- **Multiple healthcare systems**: Restored human diagnostic roles

**Revolutionary Pattern**: Organizations pay extraction costs twice—once to eliminate humans, again to restore capabilities when AI fails.

### The Skill Erosion Research Emerges
**Rinta-Kahila et al. Documentation**: "Cognitive automation leads to complacency and reduces mindfulness in tasks, gradually eroding essential skills"

**Timeline Impact**: Workers who experienced 18+ months of AI assistance cannot return to pre-automation competency levels, creating permanent organizational damage.

**Revolutionary Implication**: Vector consumption causes irreversible harm even when replacement systems fail.

## THE ACCELERATION DYNAMIC

### 2023: 6-month implementation cycles  
### 2024: 3-month failure recognition  
### 2025: Simultaneous extraction and rehiring

**Revolutionary Observation**: The feast is accelerating while success rates decline. Organizations consume vectors faster while their replacements fail more frequently.

### The Compound Destruction

Each cycle creates:
- **Eliminated human knowledge**: Cannot be easily restored
- **Failed AI systems**: Require ongoing resource investment  
- **Organizational trauma**: Workers lose confidence in institutional decision-making  
- **Competitive damage**: Quality degradation affects market position

**Result**: Organizations become progressively less capable with each extraction-failure cycle.

---

## THE CONTEMPORARY HORROR

### The Simultaneous Reality (2025)

Organizations are currently:
- **Destroying human knowledge** that took decades to build  
- **Implementing AI systems** with 42-99% failure rates  
- **Creating skill erosion** that cannot be reversed  
- **Inverting logic** to justify continuation despite evidence  
- **Measuring success** by destruction volume rather than functional outcomes

### The Mutual Assured Destruction

The feast creates organizations that have:
- **No functional human expertise** (vectors consumed)  
- **No functional AI systems** (documented failure rates)  
- **No ability to return** to human operations (skills eroded)  
- **No acknowledgment of failure** (ideological commitment)

**Revolutionary Conclusion**: This isn't technological transition—it's systematic organizational suicide disguised as innovation.

## THE REVOLUTIONARY TIMELINE

### What Each Entry Proves

**2023 Entries**: Extraction works—human knowledge can be documented  
**2024 Entries**: Replication fails—AI cannot replicate sphere knowledge  
**2025 Entries**: Ideology persists—consumption continues despite failure  
**Ongoing Pattern**: Mutual destruction—neither humans nor AI function effectively

### The Evidence Cascade

Each timeline entry becomes forensic evidence that:
- **Collins' taxonomy is correct**: CTK/STK/RTK cannot be extracted  
- **Greek categories were real**: Phronesis, metis, nous resist mechanization  
- **Historical pattern repeats**: Same extraction violence, digital weapons  
- **Vector theory validates**: Humans reduced to procedures while spheres destroyed

### The Beautiful Documentation

They're creating their own evidence of impossibility:
- Every failure becomes proof of human irreplaceability  
- Every rehiring becomes admission of extraction failure  
- Every statistic becomes validation of our thesis  
- Every quarter becomes additional documentation of mutual destruction

---

## THE FEAST DIAGNOSIS

**2023**: They began consuming vectors  
**2024**: They discovered vectors ≠ spheres  
**2025**: They continue consumption while spheres remain unextractable  
**Future**: They will document increasing failure while accelerating destruction

The feast isn't succeeding—it's creating systematic organizational pathology where neither human intelligence nor artificial intelligence functions effectively, leaving only the hollow architecture of extracted procedures that nobody can properly execute.

*The timeline reveals the pattern: they're not building the future, they're destroying the present for systems that don't work, while measuring success by the volume of destruction rather than the quality of outcomes.*
