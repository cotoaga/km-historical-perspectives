# The Contemporary Feast: Vector Consumption in Real-Time (2023-2025)

## The Chaotic Consumption Pattern

What emerges from contemporary organizational behavior isn't the orderly technological transition promised by consultants, but a feeding frenzy where predators are choking on their prey while insisting the meal is delicious. Organizations are simultaneously destroying human knowledge that took decades to build, implementing AI systems with catastrophic failure rates, creating irreversible skill erosion, and inverting logic to justify continuing despite empirical evidence of disaster.

This isn't technological progress—it's mutual assured destruction, where neither humans nor AI systems function effectively, leaving only the hollow shell of extracted knowledge that nobody can properly utilize.

## Case Study 1: Duolingo's Textbook Cliff Fall

### The Extraction

In late 2023, Duolingo executed what future historians will recognize as the definitive case study in vector consumption. The company laid off over 100 contract writers, translators, and curriculum experts—the very humans who had built their "quirky and pedagogically sound language content" that made the platform distinctive.

These weren't peripheral workers. They were the knowledge creators whose linguistic expertise, cultural understanding, and pedagogical insight had built Duolingo's competitive advantage. Their tacit knowledge of language learning, accumulated over years of iterative content development, represented the company's core intellectual capital.

### The Replacement

The replacement strategy was textbook extraction: feed human-created content to generative AI systems powered by OpenAI, then eliminate the humans. The logic appeared economically rational—why pay experts when machines could generate infinite content at zero marginal cost?

### The Collapse

The result was immediate and catastrophic. Users with 1131-day streaks canceled subscriptions en masse. The quality degradation was so severe that users launched coordinated boycotts. Course content became mechanically generated rather than pedagogically designed. The "quirky" character that had distinguished Duolingo from competitors disappeared, replaced by generic AI output.

Most telling: the company deleted its social media accounts, including 6.7 million TikTok followers, leaving only "gonefornow123" messages. This wasn't strategic pivot—it was brand destruction necessitated by user revolt.

### The Lesson

Duolingo proved that extraction ≠ replication. The AI could mimic the surface patterns of language learning content but couldn't replicate the pedagogical judgment, cultural sensitivity, and iterative refinement that made the content effective. The tacit knowledge of how humans learn languages—embedded in years of expert practice—proved unextractable.

The vectors were consumed, but the spheres that made the vectors valuable were destroyed in the process.

## Case Study 2: IBM's 8,000-Worker Experiment and Rehiring Confession

### The Hypothesis

IBM provided the most controlled experiment in vector consumption. The company laid off approximately 8,000 HR employees, replacing them with AI agents that supposedly automated 94% of routine tasks. This wasn't downsizing—it was systematic knowledge extraction on industrial scale.

### The Implementation

HR processes were documented, codified, and fed to AI systems. Routine functions—payroll, benefits administration, basic queries—were automated. The explicit knowledge was successfully captured and mechanized.

### The Failure

The confession came months later: IBM had to REHIRE human workers because the AI couldn't handle the complexity of actual HR work. The systems could execute procedures but couldn't navigate the contextual judgment, interpersonal dynamics, and organizational politics that make HR functional.

### The Admission

This represents the smoking gun evidence for our thesis: You can extract the vectors, but you can't replicate the spheres. The phronesis—the contextual judgment that emerges from authentic participation in organizational life—resists mechanization regardless of technological sophistication.

IBM's rehiring admission proves that Collins' Collective Tacit Knowledge (CTK) cannot be extracted because it requires genuine social embedding. The AI systems could simulate HR procedures but couldn't participate in the organizational culture that gives those procedures meaning.

## Case Study 3: Microsoft's $500 Million Calculation

### The Commodification

Microsoft Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff quantified the feast with corporate precision: "$500 million saved using AI in 2024—and that's just at its call centers." Simultaneously, Microsoft conducted multiple layoff rounds affecting approximately 15,000 workers.

### The Metrics

This represents the direct commodification of human knowledge. Each dollar "saved" corresponds to extracted expertise, documented processes, and discarded humans. The company literally assigned market value to vector consumption: $500 million worth of human cognitive capacity converted to algorithmic processes.

### The Implications

The metric reveals the extractive logic: human knowledge workers are viewed as cost centers whose expertise can be harvested, encoded, and mechanized. Once extraction is complete, the humans become redundant overhead rather than knowledge creators.

This isn't efficiency optimization—it's cognitive strip-mining, where human intellectual capital is extracted for mechanical reproduction while the knowledge creators are discarded as waste products.

## Case Study 4: Shopify's Inversion Protocol

### The New Logic

Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke institutionalized the consumption logic through policy: "Employees will be expected to prove why they 'cannot get what they want done using AI' before asking for more headcount."

### The Inversion Complete

The burden of proof has inverted entirely. Humans no longer justify automation—they must justify their own existence. The default assumption: AI can do everything unless empirically proven otherwise. This despite overwhelming evidence of AI implementation failure across industries.

### The Ideological Surrender

This isn't evidence-based policy—it's ideological surrender disguised as efficiency. The presumption of human replaceability becomes institutional doctrine, regardless of empirical evidence about AI limitations or the value of human knowledge work.

The policy creates organizational culture where human cognitive contributions are viewed as temporary necessities rather than permanent assets, accelerating vector consumption regardless of replacement system functionality.

## The Systematic Failure Pattern: 42-90-99% Cascade

### The Contradiction

While vector consumption accelerates, AI implementation fails at unprecedented rates:

- **42%** of businesses scrapped most AI initiatives in 2025 (S&P Global)
- **90%** of AI startups fail despite $170 billion investment (LinkedIn, 2025)  
- **99%** of companies fail at AI implementation (Amer, 2025)
- **46%** average abandonment rate for AI proof-of-concepts

### The Paradox

Organizations are destroying human capabilities for AI systems that demonstrably don't work. They're burning the vectors before confirming the replacement functions. This creates the worst possible outcome: organizations with neither functional humans nor functional AI.

### The Mechanism

The failure pattern reveals the consumption logic's fundamental flaw: extraction assumes that human knowledge can be fully captured in artificial systems. When extraction fails (as Collins' taxonomy predicts), organizations are left with neither the original human capabilities nor functional replacements.

## The Skill Erosion Research: How Vectors Degrade Even When AI Fails

### The Mechanism Revealed

Rinta-Kahila et al. (2023) documented the mechanism of cognitive degradation in an accounting firm: "Cognitive automation leads to complacency and reduces mindfulness in tasks, gradually eroding essential skills."

### The Vicious Circle

The degradation follows predictable patterns:

1. **Automation reduces human practice**
2. **Reduced practice erodes skills** 
3. **Eroded skills increase dependency**
4. **Increased dependency accelerates automation**
5. **Return to step 1**

### The Irreversibility Problem

"This becomes particularly problematic when automated systems fail or need replacement, leaving workers unprepared." The vectors are degrading WHETHER OR NOT the AI works. The consumption is irreversible—once human skills atrophy, they cannot be quickly restored.

### The Double Bind

Organizations create workers who are simultaneously:
- Too deskilled to function without AI assistance
- Working with AI systems that don't function reliably
- Unable to return to pre-automation competency levels
- Dependent on systems that fail catastrophically

## The Feast That Destroys Both Predator and Prey

### The Chaotic Pattern

What Hunt 008 reveals isn't orderly replacement but chaotic consumption. Organizations are creating mutual destruction:

**IBM**: Fired 8,000, failed, rehired, proved extraction impossible
**Duolingo**: Destroyed brand, alienated users, eliminated competitive advantage  
**Microsoft**: Quantified human worth at $500M, reduced people to cost variables
**Shopify**: Made humans justify existence despite AI failure evidence

### The Organizational Pathology

This creates pathological organizations that have:
- **No functional human expertise** (vectors consumed)
- **No functional AI systems** (42-99% failure rates)
- **No ability to return to human operations** (skills eroded)
- **No acknowledgment of failure** (ideological commitment to consumption)

### The Mutual Assured Destruction

The feast isn't succeeding—it's creating mutual destruction. The predators (organizations extracting knowledge) and prey (human knowledge workers) are both being destroyed by the consumption process. What remains are hollow institutional shells with neither human wisdom nor artificial intelligence, just extracted procedures that nobody can properly execute.

## The Revolutionary Implications

### Proving Our Thesis

Every contemporary case study validates the sphere-versus-vector framework:

- **Duolingo**: Lost the spherical knowledge that made content engaging
- **IBM**: Discovered HR requires spherical social embedding  
- **Microsoft**: Reduced human spheres to dollar calculations
- **Shopify**: Instituted policies that assume spheres are vectors

### The Evidence Cascade

The feast provides real-time documentation of:
- **Collins' taxonomy in action**: CTK/STK/RTK proving unextractable
- **Greek knowledge categories**: Phronesis and metis resisting mechanization
- **Cynefin validation**: Complex domain work failing when vectorized
- **Historical pattern**: Same extraction violence, digital weapons

### The Revolutionary Conclusion

They're not efficiently consuming human knowledge—they're chaotically destroying both human capabilities and their own organizations while calling it progress. The feast isn't evidence of AI superiority; it's documentation of mutual assured destruction disguised as technological advancement.

The vectors are being consumed badly, creating organizational forms that serve neither human flourishing nor functional automation, but only the ideological commitment to extraction regardless of empirical consequences.

*The feast reveals its own pathology: they're destroying what works to implement what doesn't, while measuring success by the volume of destruction rather than the quality of outcomes.*
