# From Guild Master to Gig Worker: The Destruction Continuum

## Medieval Guilds vs Modern Knowledge Management

| Aspect | Guild System | Modern System | What Was Lost |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Knowledge Types | All 17+ Greek categories | 4 DIKW categories | 76.5% cognitive diversity |
| Transfer Method | 7+ year apprenticeship | 2-week onboarding | Phronesis, metis, nous |
| Knowledge Control | Worker sovereignty | Corporate ownership | Autonomy → dependency |
| Innovation Source | Master craftsmen | R&D departments | Distributed → centralized |
| Quality Assurance | Peer review within guild | External metrics/KPIs | Internal → external standards |
| Career Path | Apprentice → Journeyman → Master | Junior → Senior → Redundant | Growth → disposal |

## The Mechanisms of Destruction

### Phase 1: Guild Destruction (1750-1850)
- **Narrative**: "Free trade will benefit all"
- **Reality**: Knowledge sovereignty eliminated
- **Method**: State decree + industrial capital
- **Result**: Craftsmen → factory workers

### Phase 2: Professional Destruction (2020-2030)
- **Narrative**: "AI will augment human capability"
- **Reality**: Cognitive sovereignty eliminated
- **Method**: Platform monopoly + venture capital
- **Result**: Knowledge workers → prompt engineers → unemployed

## The Property Expropriation Parallel

Guild members called it "property in skill"—they owned their knowledge. Industrial capitalism stole it through:
1. Demanding documentation of processes
2. Standardizing unique approaches
3. Encoding judgment into procedures
4. Replacing masters with machines + procedures

Sound familiar? It's exactly what's happening with:
1. "Knowledge transfer" documentation
2. "Best practice" standardization
3. Process optimization
4. AI + prompts replacing expertise

We're living through the second great knowledge expropriation.
