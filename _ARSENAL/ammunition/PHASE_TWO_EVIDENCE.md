# Phase Two Evidence: Cognitive Transfer Documentation

## Primary Evidence (Must Cite)
1. **Lake et al. (2023)** - Nature - Human error replication
2. **Binz & Schulz (2025)** - Nature - 10M decision cognitive model
3. **Wei et al. (2023)** - Chain-of-thought reasoning
4. **Dotan et al. (2024)** - Nature Human Behaviour - Feedback loops

## Supporting Artillery
5. **OpenAI (2024)** - o1 model learning reasoning
6. **Kaufmann et al. (2023)** - RLHF survey
7. **Bai et al. (2022)** - Constitutional AI
8. **Anthropic (2023)** - Collective Constitutional AI
9. **Wei et al. (2022)** - Emergent abilities
10. **Nighojkar et al. (2025)** - Personality-based reasoning
11. **Zhao et al. (2024)** - Attention mechanisms comparison

## Integration Strategy
- Use Nature papers for unassailable credibility
- Lead with error replication (Lake) - proves process transfer
- Build to Centaur model (Binz) - complete cognitive prediction
- Conclude with feedback loops (Dotan) - show co-evolution

## Revolutionary Potential
Each citation proves a piece of cognitive transfer:
- WHAT they learn: Our knowledge (Phase 1)
- HOW they learn: Our thinking (Phase 2)
- WHO learns from whom: Bidirectional (Phase 3 beginning)
