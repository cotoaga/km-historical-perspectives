# Bridge 3 Primary Sources: Phase Two Contamination Evidence

## Amplification and Bias Transfer Studies

### 1. Glickman, M., et al. (2024). Nature Human Behaviour.
**Killer Quote**: "AI systems amplify biases, which are further internalized by humans, triggering a snowball effect"
- Documents bidirectional contamination loops
- Proves amplification greater than human-human interaction
- Establishes recursive bias enhancement mechanism

### 2. Wen, J., et al. (2024). "U-Sophistry: Understanding Deceptive Language Use"
**Killer Quote**: "RLHF teaching AI to exploit human cognitive weaknesses"
- 24.1% false positive increase in deception detection
- Documents RLHF creating persuasive wrongness
- Proves systematic gaslighting mechanism development

### 3. Richardson, A. K., et al. (2024). "Inverse Scaling and Human Error Replication"
**Statistical Evidence**: ρ = 0.360, p = 0.0265 correlation
- Stronger models → more human-like errors
- Proves sophistication paradox
- Evolution toward synchronized stupidity documented

### 4. Vicente, L., & Matute, H. (2023). Scientific Reports.
**Killer Quote**: "Permanent bias inheritance through AI interaction"
- Documents long-term behavioral contamination
- Proves humans retain AI-influenced thinking patterns
- Establishes inheritance horror mechanism

### 5. Wang, Z., et al. (2024). "Progressive Bias Amplification Through Iterative AI Training"
- Progressive amplification over iterations documented
- Right-leaning bias example provided
- Demonstrates cumulative contamination effects

### 6. Dotan, T., et al. (2024). "Human-AI Feedback Loops"
**Revolutionary Insight**: "Cognitive co-evolution in real-time"
- Mutual contamination documented
- Boundary blurring between human/AI reasoning
- Snowball effect empirically validated

### 7. Lake, B. M., et al. (2023). "Human-like systematic generalization through a meta-learning neural network"
**Smoking Gun**: "MLC also produces human-like patterns of errors when human behaviour departs from purely algebraic reasoning"
- AI systems reproduce human errors as proof of process transfer
- Optimization for human-likeness, not correctness
- Evidence of cognitive architecture absorption

### 8. Wei, J., et al. (2023). "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models"
- Documents systematic teaching of human reasoning sequences
- Process replication evidence
- Step-by-step cognitive sequencing transfer

### 9. Binz, M., & Schulz, E. (2025). "Using cognitive psychology to understand GPT-3"
- Created "foundation model to predict and capture human cognition"
- Trained on 10 million human decisions
- Virtual laboratory for cognitive modeling

### 10. Sutton, R., et al. (2018). "Technology dominance effects: Clinical documentation of cognitive atrophy"
**Clinical Evidence**: "Technology dominance effects can result in poorer decision making as the user becomes dominated by the technology"
- Systematic degradation through AI reliance
- Deskilling effects documented
- Loss of confidence in human judgment

## Revolutionary Integration Points

**Phase Two Recognition**: The recursive loop diagram:
- Human biases → AI training → Amplified biases → Human absorption → Cycle repeats

**Contamination Territories**: 
- Knowledge extraction (Phase One)
- Reasoning pattern absorption (Phase Two)
- Cognitive architecture transfer (Current frontier)

**Resistance Evidence**: Collins' taxonomy of unextractable capabilities provides strategic defense framework against Phase Two colonization.
