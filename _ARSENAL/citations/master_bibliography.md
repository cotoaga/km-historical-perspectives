## Revolutionary Integration Points

### Epistemic Amnesia Concept
These citations prove our thesis isn't radical speculation but documented academic consensus:
1. **Churchman (1971)**: Knowledge is being stripped of vitality through information-reduction
2. **Williams (2024)**: Historical frameworks were more sophisticated than contemporary ones
3. **Conversational Leadership (2025)**: DIKW pyramid is "overly simplistic"
4. **Menn (1992) & Kristjánsson (2021)**: Single Greek categories contained multiplicities we can't perceive

### The Revolutionary Recognition
We're not proposing novel theory but assembling already-recognized catastrophes. The reduction from "contested multiplicities to unquestioned quaternary" represents systematic forgetting of cognitive distinctions that once defined human intellectual capacity.

**The revolution is already in the literature—it just needs assembly.**
