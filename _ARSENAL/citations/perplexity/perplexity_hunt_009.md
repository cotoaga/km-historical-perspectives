# Dave Snowden: Knowledge Management, Complexity, and Decision-Making Research Compilation (2020-2025)

## Key Publications and Sources

### 1. **Managing complexity (and chaos) in times of crisis: A field guide for decision-makers**

**Full APA Citation:** Snowden, D., & Rancati, A. (2021). *Managing complexity (and chaos) in times of crisis: A field guide for decision-makers inspired by the Cynefin framework*. Publications Office of the European Union. Luxembourg: European Commission Joint Research Centre. JRC123629.

**Brief Summary of Key Argument:** This field guide presents a four-stage approach (Assess, Adapt, Exapt, Transcend) for navigating crises using the Cynefin framework. It emphasizes the importance of understanding complexity versus chaos, building informal structures, and maintaining distributed decision-making capabilities during crisis situations[1][2][3].

**Killer Quote:** "Complex systems scale by decomposition and recombination, not by aggregation and imitation"[4].

**Thesis Support:** Strongly supports knowledge vectorization thesis by demonstrating how narrative-based sense-making and distributed ethnography can capture and process complex organizational knowledge that traditional approaches miss. The emphasis on "naturalising sense-making" directly aligns with the concept of converting tacit, distributed knowledge into actionable insights.

**Best Paper Section:** Methodology/Framework Development - particularly relevant for establishing theoretical foundations of complexity-informed knowledge management.

**Full APA Citation:** Snowden, D., & Goh, Z. (Eds.). (2020). *Cynefin: Weaving sense-making into the fabric of our world*. Cognitive Edge Pte Ltd. ISBN: 9781734510513.

**Brief Summary of Key Argument:** This collection explores the origins, evolution, and applications of the Cynefin framework through multiple perspectives. The book advocates for non-linear navigation of complex ideas, reflecting the sense-making philosophy at the core of Cynefin, with practical applications in leadership, strategy, and organizational change[5].

**Killer Quote:** "I always know more than I can say, even after I have said it, and I can always say more than I can write down"[6].

**Thesis Support:** Directly supports the knowledge vectorization thesis by demonstrating how complex, contextual knowledge can be structured and made accessible through frameworks while preserving its nuanced, interconnected nature.

**Best Paper Section:** Literature Review/Theoretical Foundation - provides comprehensive background on complexity-informed knowledge management approaches.

***

**Brief Summary of Key Argument:** Annual update on Cynefin framework matrices, introducing "Hexi form" visualization that allows for method substitution and more nuanced understanding of domain boundaries. Updates the traditional three-by-three matrices with new formats that better represent aporetic (constructive confusion) versus catastrophic confusion[7].

**Killer Quote:** "The irony of the podcast was the claim that only a tiny percentage of the population (which naturally included the participants) was capable of conceptual thinking"[8].

**Thesis Support:** Supports thesis by showing evolution of knowledge representation frameworks and demonstrating how complex knowledge structures can be continuously refined and vectorized into more accessible formats.

**Best Paper Section:** Implementation/Practical Applications - shows how theoretical frameworks translate into practical tools.

### 4. **Complex Acts of Knowing: Paradox and Descriptive Self-Awareness**

**Full APA Citation:** Snowden, D. (2002). Complex acts of knowing: Paradox and descriptive self-awareness. *Journal of Knowledge Management*, 6(2), 100-111. https://doi.org/10.1108/13673270210424639

**Brief Summary of Key Argument:** Critiques second-generation knowledge management's focus on tacit-explicit conversion, proposing a third generation that separates context, narrative, and content management. Uses complex adaptive systems theory to create sense-making models that utilize self-organizing capabilities[9][10].

**Killer Quote:** "Knowledge is seen paradoxically, as both a thing and a flow requiring diverse management approaches"[9].

**Thesis Support:** Foundational to knowledge vectorization thesis - establishes the theoretical basis for treating knowledge as complex, context-dependent, and requiring sophisticated approaches to capture and transfer.

**Best Paper Section:** Theoretical Framework/Literature Review - provides essential theoretical grounding.

***

### 5. **A Leader's Framework for Decision Making** (Harvard Business Review)

**Full APA Citation:** Snowden, D. J., & Boone, M. E. (2007). A leader's framework for decision making. *Harvard Business Review*, 85(11), 68-76.

**Brief Summary of Key Argument:** Introduces the Cynefin framework to management audiences, explaining how leaders can diagnose situations across five domains (simple, complicated, complex, chaotic, disorder) and tailor decision-making approaches accordingly. Won Academy of Management award for best practitioner paper[11][12].

**Killer Quote:** "All too often, managers rely on common leadership approaches that work well in one set of circumstances but fall short in others"[11].

**Thesis Support:** Central to thesis by demonstrating how complex decision-making knowledge can be vectorized into accessible frameworks while maintaining sophistication and contextual sensitivity.

**Best Paper Section:** Practical Applications/Case Studies - provides real-world validation of framework utility.

***

### 6. **SenseMaker Methodology Research**

**Full APA Citation:** Van der Merwe, S. E., Biggs, R., Preiser, R., Cunningham, C., Snowden, D. J., O'Brien, K., ... & Jenal, M. (2019). Making sense of complexity: Using SenseMaker as a research tool. *Systems*, 7(2), 25.

**Brief Summary of Key Argument:** SenseMaker represents a form of distributed ethnography that transfers interpretation from researchers to participants through self-signification. This removes traditional ethnographic coding and expert re-interpretation, enabling large-scale explorations while reducing researcher bias[13][14].

**Killer Quote:** "SenseMaker® entails probing to solicit micro-narratives from the system context, then looking for emergent patterns from the narratives, and responding with pattern management"[13].

**Thesis Support:** Directly exemplifies knowledge vectorization by showing how narrative-based knowledge can be systematically collected, self-interpreted, and analyzed at scale to reveal patterns invisible to traditional approaches.

**Best Paper Section:** Methodology - demonstrates novel approaches to knowledge capture and analysis.

***

### 7. **Recent Conference Presentations and Talks (2024-2025)**

**Full APA Citation:** Snowden, D. (2024, November 23). Closing keynote: KM 2025 & beyond. *KMWorld Conference*. [Video]. YouTube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIbBC4a2-mo

**Brief Summary of Key Argument:** Discusses the future of knowledge management in the age of AI, emphasizing the need for human-AI collaboration rather than replacement. Argues that AI represents "artificial inference" rather than true intelligence, and warns against cognitive atrophy from over-reliance on AI systems[15][16].

**Killer Quote:** "I sometimes worry that many people cannot distinguish between artificial intelligence and artificial inference"[17].

**Thesis Support:** Supports thesis by addressing how knowledge vectorization must account for AI capabilities while preserving human sense-making abilities and contextual understanding.

**Best Paper Section:** Future Directions/Implications - addresses emerging challenges and opportunities.

***
