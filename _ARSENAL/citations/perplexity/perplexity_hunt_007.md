Based on my extensive research across multiple academic sources, I'll provide comprehensive information about papers that cite both Michael Polanyi's "tacit knowledge" and Nonaka's SECI model, particularly focusing on why tacit knowledge remains difficult to codify or automate and recent papers questioning these frameworks in the context of AI capabilities.

# Academic Papers Citing Polanyi's Tacit Knowledge and Nonaka's SECI Model: Codification Challenges and AI Extensions

## Overview of Key Sources and Arguments

### 1. Kenneth A. Grant (2007): "Tacit Knowledge Revisited – We Can Still Learn from Polanyi"

**Full Citation (APA):**
Grant, K. A. (2007). Tacit knowledge revisited – We can still learn from Polanyi. *The Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management*, 5(2), 173-180.

**Key Argument:**
Grant argues that the knowledge management field has fundamentally misinterpreted Polanyi's work, leading to overly simplistic either/or distinctions between tacit and explicit knowledge. He demonstrates that Polanyi viewed all knowledge as having tacit components along a continuum, not as separate categories.

**Killer Quote:**
"For just as, owing to the ultimately tacit nature of all our knowledge, we remain ever unable to say all that we know, so also, in view of the tacit character of meaning, we can never quite know what is implied in what we say."

**How it supports tacit knowledge codification challenges:**
Grant's analysis reveals that Nonaka's SECI model oversimplifies Polanyi's original theory. The paper shows that many authors cite Polanyi without reading his original work, perpetuating the myth that tacit knowledge can be fully converted to explicit knowledge. This supports arguments against complete codification and automation.

**Paper section it supports:** 
Fundamental theoretical frameworks and critiques of oversimplified conversion models.

### 2. Norman Mooradian (2024): "Is Knowledge Management (Finally) Extractive? – Fuller's Argument Revisited in the Age of AI"

**Full Citation (APA):**
Mooradian, N. (2024). Is knowledge management (finally) extractive? – Fuller's argument revisited in the age of AI. *Interdisciplinary Journal of Information, Knowledge, and Management*, 19, Article 23.

**Key Argument:**
Mooradian argues that modern AI technologies (ML, DL, LLMs) provide new support for Fuller's critique that knowledge management has extractive aims. However, he contends that a more sophisticated understanding of tacit knowledge, particularly drawing on Harry Collins' threefold classification, supports a human-enabling rather than replacement vision.

**Killer Quote:**
"The faulty conception of tacit knowledge is found in its original absorption into KM by pioneers such as Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995). They held a conception in which tacit knowledge could be converted, in whole or part, into explicit knowledge. Such a conception, however, supports an extraction/automation vision."

**How it supports tacit knowledge codification challenges:**
The paper demonstrates how Collins' categories of Relational Tacit Knowledge (RTK), Somatic Tacit Knowledge (STK), and Collective Tacit Knowledge (CTK) each present different barriers to AI automation. CTK in particular cannot be mechanized because it requires social embedding.

**Paper section it supports:** 
Contemporary AI challenges and Collins' taxonomy applications.

### 3. Karsten Böhm & Susanne Durst (2025): "Knowledge Management in the Age of Generative Artificial Intelligence – From SECI to GRAI"

**Full Citation (APA):**
Böhm, K., & Durst, S. (2025). Knowledge management in the age of generative artificial intelligence–from SECI to GRAI. *VINE Journal of Information and Knowledge Management Systems*.

**Key Argument:**
Böhm and Durst propose the GRAI (Generative, Receptive Artificial Intelligence) framework as an extension of the SECI model to incorporate generative AI as an active participant in knowledge creation processes. They maintain human centrality while acknowledging AI's role.

**Killer Quote:**
"The addition of the machine as an actor in knowledge creation processes does not mean that Böhm and Durst understand both the human and machine roles as equal. Rather, they see dominance or importance of the human user in these processes."

**How it supports/challenges the thesis:**
This recent work challenges traditional SECI by showing how generative AI creates new interaction patterns, but supports the thesis that humans remain central. It demonstrates that even with AI integration, tacit dimensions persist and require human mediation.

**Paper section it supports:** 
Recent extensions and adaptations of classical models.

### 4. Research on Collins' Tacit Knowledge Classification and AI

**Multiple sources discuss Harry Collins' threefold classification:**

**Relational Tacit Knowledge (RTK):** Knowledge that is tacit due to social contingencies but could theoretically be made explicit. This presents moderate barriers to AI because it involves contextual exceptions and social dynamics.

**Somatic Tacit Knowledge (STK):** Knowledge embedded in bodily experience and skill. This presents significant barriers to AI automation because it requires embodied experience that machines cannot replicate.

**Collective Tacit Knowledge (CTK):** Knowledge embedded in social collectives through linguistic-cultural acquisition. This presents insurmountable barriers to AI because machines cannot genuinely socialize or be meaningfully embedded in human social contexts.

### 5. Recent Critical Papers (2023-2025)

Several papers from 2023-2025 question the SECI model in AI contexts:

- **Zhang et al. (2025)** propose AI-based SECI models but acknowledge the original model's human-centric limitations
- **Grimberg & Marsova (2025)** explore how external generative AI affects knowledge creation processes, finding both benefits and risks
- **Richter et al. (2024)** systematically revisit the SECI model in the context of generative AI, asking whether it's "slowly dying or resilient"

## Why Tacit Knowledge Remains Difficult to Codify/Automate

Based on the reviewed papers, several key arguments emerge:

### Structural Arguments (Polanyi-based)
1. **Essential Tacitness**: All knowledge has irreducible tacit components that enable explicit knowledge to function
2. **Gestalt Integration**: Tacit knowledge involves unanalyzable wholes that cannot be decomposed into explicit parts
3. **Personal Knowledge**: Knowledge is always personally committed and contextual

### Cognitive Arguments (Collins-based)
1. **Collective Tacit Knowledge**: Cannot be extracted because it resides in social collectives, not individuals
2. **Somatic Embodiment**: Bodily knowledge cannot be articulated but only demonstrated
3. **Social Contingencies**: Much tacit knowledge depends on social relationships and contexts

### Technical Arguments (Recent AI Research)
1. **Abductive Inference**: Hypothesis formation requires tacit intuitions beyond deductive/inductive reasoning
2. **Context Sensitivity**: AI struggles with exceptions and edge cases that require social understanding
3. **Meta-Knowledge**: Humans possess awareness of their knowledge limitations that AI lacks

## Contemporary AI Challenges to Classical Models

Recent papers show that while generative AI creates new possibilities for knowledge work, it also reveals the continued importance of tacit knowledge:

1. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Rather than replacement, AI tools require human tacit knowledge for effective operation
2. **New Interaction Patterns**: AI creates additional knowledge conversion modes but doesn't eliminate traditional ones
3. **Quality Control**: Human tacit knowledge remains essential for evaluating and contextualizing AI outputs

The reviewed literature demonstrates that both Polanyi's original insights and their extension through Collins' taxonomy remain relevant for understanding why complete automation of knowledge work remains problematic, even as AI capabilities advance significantly.
