Here are two key academic sources analyzing ancient Greek epistemological categories beyond episteme, techne, phronesis—specifically metis, nous, gnosis, sophia, dianoia, and noesis—and providing comparative frameworks for ancient and modern taxonomies:

***

## 1. Cognition in Ancient Greek Philosophy and its Reception

**APA Citation:**
Mouzala, M. G., Angelopoulou, G., Campbell, D. R., Gurtler, G. M., Haig, A. R., Kafetzopoulos, E., Kafetzopoulos, V., Kasselimis, D., Laskaris, N., Lebedev, A., Militello, C., Papageorgiou, G., Potagas, C., Sidiropoulou, K., Skaliora, I., Tolan, D. J., Tresnie, C., & Tsolakopoulos, D. (2024). *Cognition in Ancient Greek Philosophy and its Reception: Interdisciplinary Approaches*. Nomos.

**Summary:**
This edited volume offers an interdisciplinary investigation combining philosophy and neuroscience to analyze cognitive categories found throughout ancient Greek philosophy, moving past the episteme/techne/phronesis trinity to discuss faculties like *nous* (intuitive intellect), *noesis* (intellectual perception), *dianoia* (discursive reasoning), and *sophia* (wisdom)[1]. It further examines their reception and transformation in late antiquity and modern thought. The book explicitly compares ancient and modern epistemological models, highlighting the complexity and evolution of knowledge taxonomies.

**Killer Quote:**
"The authors investigate major problems of cognition and knowledge that are representative of different eras and perspectives, merging philosophical with neuroscientific analysis." [1]

**Support/Challenge to Thesis:**
This volume robustly supports the thesis by offering both analysis and comparison of distinct cognitive categories in ancient Greek thought and their relationship to modern knowledge frameworks[1].

**Relevant Section:**
Best supports the “Theoretical Framework” and “Comparative Taxonomies” sections.

## 2. Energeia, Nous and Non-Discursive Thinking in Aristotle

**APA Citation:**
Erkizan, H. N. (1997). *Energeia, nous and non-discursive thinking in Aristotle* (Doctoral dissertation, University of Bristol).

**Summary:**
This dissertation explores the detailed nuances of *nous* (intellect), *dianoia* (discursive reasoning), and *noesis* (non-discursive perception) in Aristotle’s philosophy[2]. Erkizan makes clear linguistic, ontological, and cognitive distinctions among these categories and compares the divine and human intellect, highlighting how these categories have been interpreted (and sometimes conflated) in later traditions. The author critically surveys ancient, medieval, and modern interpretations, underlining the rich, non-reductive variety of Greek epistemic categories.

**Killer Quote:**
"It is obvious that the term nous does not have a single meaning in Aristotle. It has different uses in Aristotle's philosophy. Once this is established, one of the biggest difficulties in understanding discursive and non-discursive thinking will be removed." [2]

**Support/Challenge to Thesis:**
This work strongly supports your thesis by directly analyzing *nous*, *noesis*, *dianoia*, and by challenging any oversimplified taxonomy. It also situates Aristotle’s epistemology within broader, evolving cognitive classifications—both ancient and modern[2].

**Relevant Section:**
Best supports “Analysis of Greek Categories” and “Critique of Standard Trinity” sections.

These sources together provide thorough philosophical and comparative analysis of Greek cognitive categories beyond the standard epistemological trinity, laying a strong foundation for your manuscript[1][2].
