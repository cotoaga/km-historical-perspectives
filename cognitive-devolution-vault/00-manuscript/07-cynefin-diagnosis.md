# The Cynefin Diagnosis: Systematic Incompetence

Dave Snowden's Cynefin framework provides an unexpectedly precise diagnostic tool for understanding why modern institutions consistently fail when confronting complex challenges. The framework identifies five decision-making domains, each requiring fundamentally different approaches:

**Clear**: Fixed constraints, best practices, sense-categorize-respond. Modern education excels here.

**Complicated**: Governing constraints, good practices, sense-analyze-respond. We maintain marginal competence through professional training.

**Complex**: Enabling constraints, emergent practices, probe-sense-respond. Modern education ignores this entirely.

**Chaotic**: No constraints, novel practices, act-sense-respond. We treat this as failure rather than recognizing it as a distinct domain requiring unique capabilities.

**Aporetic/Confused**: The dangerous liminal space where domain misdiagnosis creates systematic failure.
