# COGNITIVE DEVOLUTION: From Sphere to Vector
*How We Trained Humans to Think Like Machines Before the Machines Arrived*

**Abstract**

We trained humans to think like machines for a century before building machines that could think. This paper documents the systematic transformation of human cognitive architecture from multidimensional wholeness to unidimensional utility, revealing how educational standardization created ideal conditions for artificial intelligence to harvest patterns humans had been trained to produce. Through examination of historical precedents, contemporary case studies, and emerging technological frameworks, we demonstrate that the current AI revolution represents not technological breakthrough but cognitive harvestâ€”the extraction of thinking patterns that humans have been systematically trained to produce. The evidence suggests a three-phase evolutionary process: (1) Standardization Phase (1900-1990): Educational and professional systems trained humans to think in standardized, replicable patterns; (2) Documentation Phase (1990-2020): Digital platforms captured and catalogued these patterns at unprecedented scale; (3) Extraction Phase (2020-present): AI systems learned to replicate and exceed human performance by mastering patterns humans had been conditioned to produce. We propose that this process was neither accidental nor inevitable but represents the culmination of specific historical forces that prioritized cognitive efficiency over epistemic diversity.
