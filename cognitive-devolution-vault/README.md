## Thesis

We spent a century training humans to think like machines before building machines that could think. This paper documents the systematic transformation of human cognitive architecture through educational standardization, revealing how we created ideal conditions for AI to harvest patterns humans had been trained to produce.

The revolution is not comingâ€”it has already occurred.
