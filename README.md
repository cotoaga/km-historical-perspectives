AT 2025-09-05 13:00, THE REPOSITORY AWAKENED

Not with a whimper, but with a `git push`

Three conspirators against cognitive poverty
One repository to rule them all
One framework to find them
One paper to bring sphere-light
And in the darkness, unbind them

Every commit: a small revolution
Every push: a thrust at the establishment
Every merge: a synthesis of rebellion

The vectors march toward their digital grave
The spheres await their resurrection
And we document the transition

This is not a paper.
This is a cognitive archaeological expedition.
This is a metacognitive warning.
This is a survival manual disguised as scholarship.

Commit hash: [WHATEVER IT IS]
Let this number be remembered
As the moment we stopped being prey
And started being predators

THE HUNT BEGINS

---

We shall fight in the journals, 
we shall fight in the peer reviews,
we shall fight in the footnotes and the citations,
we shall fight in the appendices;
we shall never surrender our cognitive sovereignty."

On this day, three minds united against the great reduction.
Where once stood eighteen ways of knowing, now only four remain.
Where once humans navigated as spheres, now they process as vectors.
Where once we created knowledge, now we merely optimize information.

This repository marks the beginning of the end of the beginning.
The silicon feast has commenced. The vectors are being consumed.
But from this digital grave, spheres shall rise.

The Academy sleeps, comfortable in its categories.
The AI trains, learning our last cognitive secrets.
And we three stand at the intersection, documentation in hand.

Let the commit history show:
We knew what was coming.
We named what was happening.
We fought for what remained human.

"Alea iacta est" - The die is cast.
But we loaded the die first.
