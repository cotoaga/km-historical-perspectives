# MISSION 1: The Core Thesis Hunt
Find recent academic papers (2020-2025) that discuss how educational systems prepare knowledge workers for automation or AI displacement. Include papers about "deskilling," "cognitive taylorism," "knowledge commodification," or "epistemic monocultures." I need papers that either support or could be reframed to support the thesis that we've trained humans to think like machines. Include both supportive and critical perspectives.

# MISSION 2: Greek Knowledge Types Archaeological Dig
Search for academic sources discussing ancient Greek epistemological categories beyond the standard episteme/techne/phronesis trinity. Find papers that discuss: metis (cunning intelligence), nous (intuitive intellect), gnosis (experiential knowledge), sophia (wisdom), dianoia (discursive reasoning), noesis (intellectual perception). I need scholarly sources that analyze these as distinct cognitive categories, especially papers comparing ancient and modern knowledge taxonomies.

# MISSION 3: The Cynefin Connection
Find papers that cite Dave Snowden's Cynefin framework in relation to knowledge management, educational systems, or AI/automation. Particularly interested in papers discussing the "complicated vs complex" domain distinction in organizational knowledge. Include any papers that discuss the "cliff" between domains or the danger of applying complicated domain solutions to complex problems.

# MISSION 4: The AI Metacognition Evidence
Search for recent papers (2023-2025) on "prompt engineering," "chain of thought reasoning," "reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)," or "constitutional AI" that discuss how AI systems learn human reasoning patterns. Find evidence that AI is learning not just what we know but HOW we think. Include papers on "emergent capabilities" in large language models.

# MISSION 5: Historical Precedent Ammunition
Find academic sources on medieval guild systems as knowledge management structures, particularly focusing on: tacit knowledge transmission, master-apprentice relationships, guild secrecy, and the destruction of guilds by industrialization. Include papers comparing guild knowledge systems to modern professional education or corporate knowledge management.

# MISSION 6: The Counter-Argument Arsenal
Find the strongest papers arguing AGAINST the thesis that AI will replace knowledge workers. Search for "human-AI complementarity," "augmented intelligence," "irreplaceable human skills," or "the limits of automation." I need to know what Reviewer 2 will throw at us so we can pre-emptively destroy their arguments.

# MISSION 7: The Polanyi-Nonaka Bridge
Find papers that cite both Michael Polanyi's "tacit knowledge" and Nonaka's SECI model, especially those discussing why tacit knowledge remains difficult to codify or automate. Include recent papers questioning or extending these frameworks in the context of AI capabilities.

# MISSION 8: The Contemporary Disasters
Search for documented cases (2023-2025) of AI implementation failures in knowledge work contexts, similar to the Duolingo situation. Look for: "AI adoption failure," "automation backlash," "algorithmic displacement," or "digital transformation failure." Need real examples of the vector-consumption already happening.

# MISSION 9: The Dave Snowden Special
Find all papers by Dave Snowden or citing Dave Snowden from 2020-2025 that discuss knowledge management, complexity, or decision-making in organizations. Include his recent blog posts or conference talks that might not be formally published. We need to show deep engagement with his work.

# SPECIAL RECONNAISSANCE: The Smoking Gun
Find any papers that explicitly discuss education creating "human computers" or comparing modern knowledge workers to "biological processors." Search for terms like "cognitive capitalism," "mental taylorism," "algorithmic thinking in education," or "computational pedagogy." These papers might directly support our core thesis without needing reinterpretation.

# CITATION FORMATTING REQUEST:
