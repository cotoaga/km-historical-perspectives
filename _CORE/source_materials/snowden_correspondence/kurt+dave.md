Hi Dave,

Kurt Cotoaga here - we met at your Paris Masterclass last year where we discussed the Cynefin applications in complexity. I was one of the volunteers to the last "being grilled by the group" round. ;-)

I've been developing a thought leadership series called "On Knowledge" that deconstructs how our educational system created "knowledge workers" perfectly optimized for AI replacement. The thesis explores how we reduced 2,500 years of Greek cognitive distinctions (18 types of knowing - OK, I know, different times, different schools but definitely more as today) down to the impoverished DIKW pyramid - essentially training humans to think like machine learning algorithms.

The series traces how we systematically converted human minds from "cognitive spheres" (capable of cross-domain synthesis, contextual wisdom, emergence navigation) into "specialist vectors" (pattern matchers optimized for narrow domains). Now AI systems are consuming these vectors with devastating efficiency.

Given your work on complexity, sense-making, and the limitations of best-practice thinking in complex domains, I'd be genuinely interested in your critical perspective on this framework. Particularly:

- The epistemological archaeology of knowledge management frameworks
- The sphere vs. vector cognitive topology metaphor
- The implications for sense-making in the AI age
- Whether the Greek knowledge distinctions offer viable alternatives to current paradigms

The series has generated significant engagement (30K+ impressions on related content) and seems to be hitting a nerve with knowledge workers sensing their vulnerability but lacking frameworks to understand it.

Would you be willing to take a critical look at the series? I'd value your thoughts - whether supportive, critical, or dismissive. Your perspective on complex adaptive systems and organizational sense-making could add important depth to this conversation.

The complete series is available at:

Act III: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/knowledge-act-iii-welcome-ai-feast-kurt-cotoaga-dbukf/

No expectations - just respect for your thinking and curiosity about your take on this particular angle into the AI displacement question.

Best regards, Kurt

P.S. I am still pondering with the idea for a Hexi Repair Kit for derailed SAFe ARTs (which would be ALL) as I consider it by now a dead framework.

If this is still relevant, then I can look through them next week.

Hello Dave,

thank you so much for not forgetting my inquiry! üòÉ

Yes, I would highly appreciate your willingness to review my "On Knowledge" series.
Intro: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/survival-success-kit-knowledge-workers-smes-age-ai-kurt-cotoaga-zypcf/
Act I: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/knowledge-act-i-beyond-dikw-pyramid-kurt-cotoaga-9573f/
Act II: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/act-iii-knowledge-slave-factory-kurt-cotoaga-eqypf/

It is something I am brewing for a long time in my mind.
In my mind it makes of course perfectly sense, but I have learned the hard way that this is not at all a proof that it works in any other mind.

Please keep also in mind: I wrote it, to get some attention on LinedIn, so it is perhaps here and there slightly over-dramatized. ;-)

Let me frame the specific intellectual territory I'm exploring:

Core Thesis: The systematic reduction of human cognitive complexity (18+ Greek knowledge typesI'm synthesizing across schools and centuries) into the DIKW pyramid created the perfect conditions for AI displacement by converting "sphere navigators" into "specialist vectors."

The Complexity Angle: What we call "knowledge management" is actually **complexity reduction** - forcing the full spectrum of human knowing into four simple categories that can be codified. This produces excellent specialists for Complicated domain work, but eliminates the cognitive diversity needed for Complex/Chaotic navigation. What about tacit knowledge? What about the art of the Polynesian navigators?

The Historical Crime: Educational systems systematically converted integrated human minds (cognitive spheres capable of cross-domain synthesis) into specialized pattern-matchers (vectors optimized for narrow domains). AI systems now literally consume these vectors with devastating efficiency precisely because we trained humans to think like machine learning algorithms.

Where I'd Value Your Perspective and Critique:
1. Complexity Topology: Does the sphere/vector metaphor map meaningfully to your work on complex adaptive systems?
2. Epistemological Archaeology: Is the Greek knowledge diversity vs. DIKW reduction a valid historical/conceptual framework?
3. Sense-making Implications: In a world where AI excels at pattern-matching, what cognitive capabilities become uniquely human?
4. Practical Application: How might organizations cultivate "sphere capabilities" rather than optimizing vector efficiency?

The series argues that phronesis (practical wisdom), nous (intuitive intellect), and sophia (wisdom about ultimate causes) remain indigestible to AI systems - but only if we stop systematically eliminating them through reductive "good practices" or even worse "best practice".

The Stakes: If this analysis holds, we're witnessing the end-game of a 40-year knowledge management experiment that accidentally optimized humans for replacement.

Your perspective on whether this constitutes genuine complexity thinking or sophisticated intellectual theater would be invaluable.

Best regards,  
Kurt

Do you plan to publish it?

Hello Dave,

I would love to, of course in a polished version.
Why are you asking?
Is my train of thought somehow right?

Well its sits between a social media post and an article at the moment.   Not enough bite for social media. but needs better narrative threading for an article.   Personally I would make it an article and I don‚Äôt think it would be difficult to get it publised.  The essence is in this quote: "We spent decades training humans to be biological AI systems - and now the silicon versions have arrived to collect their inheritance.‚Äù However, this needs to be front and centre, with issues and solutions then threaded into a cohesive action-oriented conclusion.  Also, some care over wayfinding, which is cultural appropriation in some manifestations.

Happy to link as is, but better in a different form

Hello Dave,

Thank you for this invaluable guidance - exactly what I needed to decide on "what am I actually doing with this?". On LinkedIn it is spoiled, so I will transform this into rigorous academic work!

Your structural insights are spot-on: front-loading that central thesis, threading solutions systematically, and developing action-oriented conclusions. I'll also address the cultural sensitivity around wayfinding examples.

I'm heading off for vacation (like most of Europe at the moment) but will begin the restructuring work in mid-August. Would it be presumptuous to occasionally seek your perspective as I develop the academic version? No expectation of detailed review - just the occasional "am I on the right track?" sanity check.

Either way, your input has already elevated this significantly. Much appreciated.

Best regards,  
Kurt

P.S. I am witnessing the vector-assimilation live during my trainings and workshops on ethical AI use to leverage human reasoning not to automate stupid workflows. It is hard work to get people away from the "how can AI automate my workflows attitude". Germany is desperately applying complicated-domain solutions to complex-domain challenges - exactly the kind of Cynefin confusion your work predicts. Ruthless triage and some palliative medical treatment is the only thing I can do here‚Ä¶
