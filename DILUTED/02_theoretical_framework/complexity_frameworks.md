# Complexity Frameworks in Knowledge Management

## The Cynefin Framework

Snowden and Boone's (2007) Cynefin framework provides valuable distinctions between different problem domains, particularly the complicated versus complex distinction. This framework has found applications across disciplines, from biomedical research (Kempermann, 2017) to educational systems (Weaving Futures, n.d.).

## Domain Classifications and Knowledge Requirements

The framework suggests different domains require different knowledge approaches:
- Simple domains benefit from best practices and standardized procedures
- Complicated domains require expert analysis and specialized knowledge
- Complex domains necessitate emergent practices and adaptive responses
- Chaotic domains demand immediate action and crisis management

## Implications for Contemporary Challenges

Recent scholarship has applied these distinctions to artificial intelligence integration (Morisse, 2024), suggesting that domain misclassification may contribute to implementation challenges. The concept of the "cliff"—the boundary between simple and chaotic domains—serves as a useful metaphor for organizational risks in automation strategies.
